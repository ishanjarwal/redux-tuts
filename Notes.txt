# React Redux
It is a library that connects states of redux with states of react.
states in react and states in redux are completely different so it does the mapping
it also gives some hooks to be used.

react-redux gives access to a "Provider" in which the App component can be wrapped so that the global state can be accessed anywhere in the tree.

1. useSelector hook : returns the Global states
to get a specific state from useSelector, : useSelector(state=>state.account.amount)

2. useDispatch hook : gives access to dispatch function directly

most of the state management has shifted to redux files instead of react files.

handling async dispatch : similar to what we made earlier, make 3 dispatches loading, success and fail
and we can change the ui according to the response we get from the api
