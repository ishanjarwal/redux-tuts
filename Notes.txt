# Redux Tool Kit
in this, we create slices
from createSlice() method
it takes an object
createSlice({
    name: 'reducername',
    initialState: initialState,
    reducers : {
        'action_creator' : (state, action) => {
            state.amount += 1;
        }
    }
})

note : it looks like state is changed mutably but IMMER library automatically makes a copy

then in the slice file, export 2 things
1. named export of all the action creators from slice.actions
2. default export of reducer from slice.reducer.

these can be accessed in the store 

configure the store in main.jsx

The name in createSlice is important coz it decides the name of actions and states

redux toolkit also provides two methods : createReducer and createAction
In case you don't want to use slice method, you can create and export actions and reducers with these two
syntax : 
export const increment = createAction('reward/increment');
const rewardReducer = createReducer(initState, (builder)=>{
    builder
        .addCase(increment, (state, action)=>{
            state.points++;
        })
})
export default rewardReducer

problem statement : increase bonus to 1 if amount is increase by 100 or greater
ans : use extraReducer in the slice of bonus
